Stack Class
Step 1: Creating the Stack Class
	 Define a class called Stack with an array to store stack elements.
	 Include methods push (add elements), pop (remove elements), and
	isEmpty(check if the stack is empty).
Step 2: Using the Stack Class
	 In the main method:
	 Create an instance of the Stack class.
	 Push a series of integers onto the stack.
	 Display the contents of the stack after each push.
	 Pop elements from the stack and display them until the stack is empty.
Step 3: Additional Operations
	 Implement a peek method to display the top element without removing it.
	 Handle underflow conditions when popping from an empty stack
